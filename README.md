# cs2102-project

In this module, my teammates and I created a database system for an IT company that conducts training courses. We wrote functions that make complex database queries. We also implement triggers to make sure the database constraints are not violated. 

Some example functions are: add_employee, remove_employee, find_instructors, get_available_rooms and many others.

The main language used is PL/pgSQL.

Thank you for reading!
